# Personality-Analyzer-HTN
Analyzes user personality based on the public Tweets posted on twitter.
This uses the Twitter API and IBM Watson API. IBM Watson takes in tweets from the Twitter API and analyzes the personality and returns the results


To run the project, you can run the following command - 

1) For a single person personality analyzer you need to run singleAnalyzer.py

  `python singleAnalyzer.py <user_name>`
  
2) To dump it into a file, uncomment the following:

  ` #with open ('BestResults.txt', 'w') as outfile:
    #  outfile.write(B) `
